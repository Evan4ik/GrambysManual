<div id="controls"><h2> Controls </h2></div>
<p> Most controls that the game tells you like Left Click (M1), Right click (M2), Q and E aren't the only controls in the game. Controls like CTRL+M1/CTRL+M2, P, or SHIFT+E or Q aren't told by the game. I'll go over each one right now. </p>
<ul>
 <li>M1 / Left Click - Pick up / drop item with left hand.</li>
 <li>M2 / Right Click - Pick up / drop item with right hand.</li>
 <li>Q - Use / activate item in left hand.</li>
 <li>E - Use / activate item in right hand.</li>
 <li>CTRL+M1/M2 - Pick up item without detaching it from the assembly in left or right hand.</li>
 <li>P - Open up piano menu, where you can play on a keyboard with certain items.</li>
 <li>SHIFT+E/Q - This opens up a settings menu for some items like radio or tripwire, and many others.</li>
</ul>

<div id="basics"><h2> Basics </h2></div>
<p> This game has a lot of essential basics you have to know to know how to get good at the game. Here's some very popular basic questions i'll answer here. Q stands for Question and A stands for Answer.
<ul>
 <li> Q: Why is the game not loading for me?? </li>
 <li> A: This is a bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why is someone hopping at light speed in my game??? </li>
 <li> A: This is another bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: How do I change toolgun mode??? </li>
 <li> A: You hold Q or E and scroll up or down, or you do Shift+Q or E in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why did my pie explode when I spawned it in??? </li>
 <li> A: Its a reference to a spongebob episode, where if you flip a pie upside down and it touches anything - it explodes. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> That is most frequent questions answered, now we'll move onto basic things like how to rotate spinners, how to power a light, etc. </p>

 <li> Q: How do I rotate a spinner / bearing? </li>
 <li> A: You have to first spawn in a switch, and then place the spinner on the circle-shaped switch spot. You can ignore the switch for now, other that it can be activated to make the spinner spin, as we're going to go over the switch and wiring in the <a href="#wiring">wiring</a> category. </li>
 <br> 
 <li> Q: How do I change the direction of a spinner / bearing? </li> <img src="./images2/spinner_rotate.PNG" style="float:left; margin:0px 15px 15px 0px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="130" height="123" alt="" />
 <li> A: You need to hold Q or E on it and look up or down, this may be changed to Shift+E or Q in the future. </li>
 <br>

 <br> <img src="./images2/refuel.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="267" height="215" alt="" />
 <li> Q: How do I refuel my car or thrusters? </li>
 <li> A: You can refuel them using the item "canister" or "jug" by picking the canister or jug up, bringing them over to the thing you have to refuel, and holding e or q on them, depending on which hand you have the canister or jug in. There is another way, but we'll discuss it in the <a href="#building">building</a> category. </li>
