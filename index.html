<div id="controls"><h2> Controls </h2></div>
<p> Most controls that the game tells you like Left Click (M1), Right click (M2), Q and E aren't the only controls in the game. Controls like CTRL+M1/CTRL+M2, P, or SHIFT+E or Q aren't told by the game. I'll go over each one right now. </p>
<ul>
 <li>M1 / Left Click - Pick up / drop item with left hand.</li>
 <li>M2 / Right Click - Pick up / drop item with right hand.</li>
 <li>M3 / Scroll Wheel - Unlocks your cursor from being in the center of the screen.</li>
 <li>Q - Use / activate item in left hand.</li>
 <li>E - Use / activate item in right hand.</li>
 <li>C - Activates VIP server flying</li>
 <li>CTRL+M1/M2 - Pick up item without detaching it from the assembly in left or right hand.</li>
 <li>P - Open up piano menu, where you can play on a keyboard with certain items.</li>
 <li>SHIFT+E/Q - This opens up a settings menu for some items like radio or tripwire, and many others.</li>
 <li>X - Third person mode / go out of camera vision</li>
 <li>R - Ragdolls character.</li>
 <li>Z - Activates VIP server spawn menu</li>
 <li>F - Turns on fone, which has many apps.</li>
 <li>CTRL + Shift / CTRL / Shift = Gestures</li>

<div id="basics"><h2> Basics </h2></div>
<p> This game has a lot of essential basics you have to know to know how to get good at the game. Here's some very popular basic questions i'll answer here. Q stands for Question and A stands for Answer.
<ul>
 <li> Q: Why is the game not loading for me?? </li>
 <li> A: This is a bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why is someone hopping at light speed in my game??? </li>
 <li> A: This is another bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li>Q: How far away is gramby?? </li>
 <li> A: Gramby is 115 miles away from spawn. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: How do I change toolgun mode??? </li>
 <li> A: You hold Q or E and scroll up or down, or you do Shift+Q or E in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why did my pie explode when I spawned it in??? </li>
 <li> A: Its a reference to a spongebob episode, where if you flip a pie upside down and it touches anything - it explodes. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: What do the things under the hood of my car do?? </li>
 <li> A: The fish tank (left most item) acts as coolant adding or removing fuel from it does nothing but your car will run without it. Potato engine (middle item) does not have fuel but it is essential to run your car, Spring Juice (right most item) controls the suspension of your car adding fuel will make your suspension weaker and longer while removing fuel makes your suspension stiffer and shorter it is essential to run your car aswell. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why is my car not running?? </li>
 <li> A: It could be missing an essential part that it needs to run, the minimum amount of things a car needs to run is listed as such - 1 seat, steering wheel (only essential for turning, or any item you can put on the car), potato engine, and fuel in chassis (if it needs fuel) </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: There is a giant hole in the ground how do I get past it?? </li>
 <li> A: That giant hole is a ravine that spawns in every server that you must get past to progress,  you will have to fly over it using thrusters and balloons or you will have to leave your car behind and walk the rest of the way </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q:Why cant i attach the brief case to anything? </li>
 <li> A:The brief case is a loose item meaning that you cant attach it directly to anything without the use of a joust or plunger. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> That is most frequent questions answered, now we'll move onto basic things like how to rotate spinners, how to power a light, etc. </p>
<ul>
<img src="./images2/spinner.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="479" height="143" alt="" />
 <li> Q: How do I rotate a spinner / bearing? </li>
 <li> A: You have to first spawn in a switch, and then place the spinner on the circle-shaped switch spot. You can ignore the switch for now, other that it can be activated to make the spinner spin, as we're going to go over the switch and wiring in the <a href="#wiring">wiring</a> category. </li>
 <br> <img src="./images2/spinner_rotate.PNG" style="float:left; margin:0px 15px 15px 0px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="130" height="123" alt="" />
 <li> Q: How do I change the direction of a spinner / bearing? </li> 
 <li> A: You need to press Shift+E/Q on it and turn on reverse. </li> 
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br> <img src="./images2/refuel.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="267" height="215" alt="" />
 <li> Q: How do I refuel my car or thrusters? </li>
 <li> A: You can refuel them using the item "canister" or "jug" by picking the canister or jug up, bringing them over to the thing you have to refuel, and holding e or q on them, depending on which hand you have the canister or jug in. There is another way, but we'll discuss it in the <a href="#building">building</a> category. </li>
</ul>
